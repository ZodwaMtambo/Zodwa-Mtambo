 Project Overview
I developed a comprehensive Executive Sales Dashboard in Excel that transforms raw sales data into actionable business insights, consolidating R2,328.6K in total revenue across multiple dimensions including geographic distribution, temporal trends, and product categories. Using advanced Excel techniques, I created dynamic visualizations including geographic analysis through horizontal bar charts showing sales performance across 12+ countries, monthly sales trends with multi-year comparison spanning 2009-2013, year-over-year trend lines demonstrating consistent revenue growth, and market segmentation via pie charts breaking down top-selling genres with Rock leading at 46%, followed by TV Shows, Alternative & Punk at 13%, Metal at 15%, and Latin at 11%. This dashboard addresses critical business needs by providing at-a-glance KPIs for C-level executives, delivering market intelligence that identifies top-performing regions and product categories, enabling performance tracking through trend analysis and forecasting, and guiding resource allocation decisions based on data-driven insights. The technical implementation utilized dynamic named ranges for scalable data management, conditional formatting for visual performance indicators, interconnected charts that update automatically with new data, and a responsive layout optimized for executive presentation.
